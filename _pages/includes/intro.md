Hi there, I am Shumo Wang (Chinese name: 王书墨). I am currently a **PhD student** in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/), [Northeastern University (Shenyang, China)](https://www.neu.edu.cn). I am also a **visiting student** at the [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/) (Turin, Italy) from April 2024 to April 2026, funded by the [CSC](https://www.csc.edu.cn/).

My research interests focus on **real-time systems**, **causal chains**, **end-to-end latency analysis**, ROS2, and shared resource management <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xTNPUUAAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fshumowang0102%2Fshumowang0102.github.io%2Fgoogle-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Recently, I've focused on: jitter propagation and optimization in task chains.


My research aims to capture **uncertainty** in real-time scheduling.
